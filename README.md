# Rust-Crash (course)

This is a mini repo with small code snippets which will help to quickly get started with this great rust language.

This repo is organized with topics as files names in src folder. Look belowðŸ‘‡ to get short description of each file/topic

## Files
- array. rs -> All about arrays in rust
	> **Note:** arrays in rust are nonexpendable. Rather we use vectors.
- conditionals. rs -> all about if/else statement in rust.
- loop. rs -> all about loops such as while/for in rust.
- print. rs -> different ways of using println! statement in rust.
- strings. rs -> commonly used methods and unique concept about string in rust.
- tuples. rs -> all about tuples in rust.
- types. rs -> all about different primitive datatypes in rust (needs more work).
- vars. rs -> declaring vars in rust using let/ const.
- vector. rs -> expandable arrays in rust also known as vectors.
- main. rs -> It's the entry point of the program, also there must be main named function which is used as entry point.
